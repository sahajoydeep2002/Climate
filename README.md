## What is Climate
Climate is a weather details showing web app(Temperature, Condition, Humidity & wind-speed) with a chat feature where you can get like minded community.

## How we built it
The webapp was made using openweather API, HTML, CSS & Javascript to get different locations weather deatils(temperature, wind speed etc) with a chatting feature using PyWebIO

## Challenges we ran into
I was working with PywebIO for the first time. Coding the chatting app with python was quite challenging.

## Conclusion
Do you think it's a useless app just because you already have a weather app?

Ok you can think, I also think so. Just KEEP THINKING. Don't change your mind.

But it has some new features like changing backgrounds with location change and Chatting feature for weather or Climate discussion.

## What's next for Climate
More attractive, secure & featured chatting app about weather or Climate to keep those like minded people connected.

Launch a mobile app of Climate using these features for easy access
